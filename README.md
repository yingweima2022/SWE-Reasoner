# SWE-Reasoner

## Overview

**SWE-Reasoner**:  is an open-source large language model specifically designed for software improvement. Built upon the foundation of the Qwen series base models, SWE-Reasoner has undergone additional LongCoT training using software engineering development process data to enhance its capabilities in solving complex software engineering tasks.

**SWESynInfer+**: four-stage software engineering process data synthesis and inference workflow. SWE-SynInfer divides the issue resolution process into three steps: (1) repository understanding to identify relevant codebase files, (2) fault localization to pinpoint problematic code segments, and (3) patch generation to produce candidate code edits. We extend this framework to include a Patch Verification phase, following Agentless, and call it SWE-SynInfer+.

## Model Performance

SWE-Reasoner has demonstrated impressive performance in software engineering tasks:

- ðŸŒŸ Achieved a **37.60% (32B) solution rate on the authoritative SWE-bench Verified** leaderboard for software engineering intelligent agents.
- ðŸŒŸ When combined with External TTC (budget=8), our modelâ€™s performance further **increases to 46.0%**.
